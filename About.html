  ready to take on new challenges! So far I've really enjoyed
  bulding this webpage with html and CSS. I used a little Sketch also to build
  the links on this site. I'm excited to work with DALI because I can't wait to learn
  more tools for this programs in a group setting while working on meaningful projects.<p> </center>
